<p>My name is <b>Brice Bernard</b>, I work as a <b>front-end developer</b> for <a target='_blank' href='https://happiour.com/'>Happiour</a>.<br />
The aim was to gather exclusive offers from various vendors and show the relevant ones to users based on their location. I was in charge of the front-end for the dashboard (<a href='https://business.happiour.com/'>https://business.happiour.com/</a>) that vendors used to create and manage their offers, we used AngularJS 1.5+, Stylus, Node.JS.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked for Webassadors, a french startup that was creating a social network to bring together brands and selected fans, that then would act as "ambassadors" in their own network. Worked on the social platform using AngularJS, Stylus and some Bootstrap elements.
<p>Before that, I obtained a master in Computer Science, and did some software development through school projects and internships. However the web is home, after toying with it when I was a kid, I had to come back.</p>

<p>On a personal side, I love <b>discovering new things</b>. I think that's why I love the web so much, it's always in motion and it feels like new ideas can grow easily, this is awesome.</p>
