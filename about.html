<p>My name is <b>Brice Bernard</b>, I work as a <b>front-end developer</b> for <a target='_blank' href='https://www.webassadors.com'>Webassadors</a>. I mostly use AngularJS and started to use React aswell.<br />
Before that, I obtained a master in Computer Science, and did some software development through school projects and internships. However the web is home, after toying with it when I was a kid, I had to come back.</p>

<p>On a personal side, I love <b>discovering new things</b>. I think that's why I love the web so much, it's always in motion and it feels like it's still early enough to let new ideas and people come and grow easily, this is awesome.</p>
